What we have here is perhaps one of the best tesseract models for Indic Scripts you will find in open source world. Get in touch with us if you want to train models for a particular font and we will be able to help you out.  \r\n\r\n###So... what are these tools? \r\nTools | And what they are\r\n------|--------------------\r\n[Tessdata](https://indic-ocr.github.io/tessdata/) | Set of highly accurate [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) OCR models for Indic Scripts which include [Ol Chiki (Santali)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1C50.pdf)  and [Meetei Meyek (Manipuri)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UABC0.pdf) scripts too\r\n[Olena](https://indic-ocr.github.io/olena/) | Perhaps the best set of tools available for layout detection in open source world.\r\n[OCR Service](https://indic-ocr.github.io/ocrservice/) | Host your own ocr service within your organisation or community (Batteries included)\r\n[LibreOCR](https://indic-ocr.github.io/LibreOCR/) | Open an image in [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org) and convert it to editable document... just like that.  \r\n[Across India](https://indic-ocr.github.io/acrossindia/) | Nearly a  [Word Lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_Lens) clone of Indian Languages, but it transliterates instead of translation. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0WVCOieW6o)  \r\n[Indic Messenger](https://indic-ocr.github.io/indicmessenger/) | Get transliterations of sign boards in Indian languages through a Facebook chat bot :-) . Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dpx5neMZSk) . Add [Indic OCR](https://www.facebook.com/indicocr/) on your [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/). \r\n[Indic OCR for Chrome](https://indic-ocr.github.io/chromeindic/) | A [Project Naptha](http://projectnaptha.com) wannabe which currently support conversion of text in images on web pages to editable (copyable) form. [Install on Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/indic-ocr/fejbddkpnmcnobmalnkflaljnlffblma)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n###Participate\r\n\r\nOCR for Indian language is still a challenging field and Indic OCR project is an attempt to build a community of developers who can help solve some of the problems in way to achieve 100% accuracy. \r\n\r\nPlease join me in taking this project further and build more tools for Indian users. \r\n\r\n###Author\r\n\r\n@rkvsraman\r\n\r\n\r\n",
