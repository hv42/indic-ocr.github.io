## Hello

Indic-OCR is a collection of open source tools to enable OCRs in Indic Scripts.  

Indic-OCR tools use [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and [Olena](https://indic-ocr.github.io/olena/) for layout detection. 

Indic-OCR project provides a set of [tesseract ocr models](https://indic-ocr.github.io/tessdata/) which have been trained using some special techniques customised for Indic Scripts. What we have here is perhaps one of the best tesseract models for Indic Scripts you will find in open source world. Get in touch with us if you want to train models for a particular font and we will be able to help you out.  

###So... what are these tools?
